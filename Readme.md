MenuBuilder (Json)
------------------

This is a PyGTK3 menu builder that is meant for extensibility of the menu, keybinding, and command files. The main intention is to allow pluggable modules to add and maintain their own menu items, even potentially overwrite other menu items.

The is inspired by and should remain compatable with Sublime-Text style menu json definitions.
